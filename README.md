# nft-teleporter-faber-hackathon
## NFT Teleporter, is a no code service which alows users to easily create NFT's and NFT collections which they can then teleport into the Metaverse. Currently a proof of concept, our teleporter leverages IPFS's NFT Storage solutions, along with modern day 3D model file types, to allow NFT's to be created through a simple UI, minted and made viewable/interactable in VR (and soon AR) all inside of the web browser with the click of a button! <br> <br> Our service opens the doorway for unique interactive experiences to be attached to NFT's (through IPFS), along with multiple assets simultaneously, which can increase the value and utility of an NFT.
