            <h2>Teleport Your NFT's into the Metaverse!</h2>
            <p>NFT Teleporter, is a no code service which alows users to easily create NFT's and NFT collections which they can then teleport into the Metaverse. Currently a proof of concept, our teleporter leverages IPFS's NFT Storage solutions, along with modern day 3D model file types, to allow NFT's to be created through a simple UI, minted and made viewable/interactable in VR (and soon AR) all inside of the web browser with the click of a button!</p>
            <p>Our service opens the doorway for unique interactive experiences to be attached to NFT's (through IPFS), along with multiple assets simultaneously, which can increase the value and utility of an NFT. By attaching multiple assets in different dimensions (audio, 2D, 3D etc.), we can bring NFT's to live in the digital world quickly and easily.</p>

              <h3>No Code Custom VR Experiences</h3>
              <p>Our service allows NFT creators to easily upload relevant meta data which you would usually associate with an NFT, along with digital 3D models and other exciting data that we turn into an IPFS hosted interactable experience automatically. These experiences are then made exclusively available to white listed wallets.</p>

              <h3>Build Your NFT With a Simple UI</h3>
              <p>We empower artists and designers to build and upload their very own NFTs and NFT collections to IPFS, using our simple UI. We athenticate an artist via their Metamask wallet, and then save all relevant NFT data to IPFS. This is then stored as an object on our express server, which can be retrieved by the user either through our website UI or our REST API at any time.</p>

            <div class="how-it-works__points">
              <h3>Retrieve Data to Build Bespoke Experiences Later</h3>
              <p>We understand that many creators are in a rush to launch, but don't want to offer subpar experiences at the same time. The 3D model data, along with all other NFT data that we save to IPFS can be retrieved at a later point to build bespoke experiences off platform whenever it suits the creator. Up front we can provide a small set of experiences using custom data, and then the NFT creator can expand on this when they are able using our REST API.</p>

              <h3>Smart Contract Integration</h3>
              <p>NFT Teleporter currently offers users the opportunity to lazy mint their NFT's on Rarible, with hopes to expand this to an full minting feature than can be embedded on a users website at a later date.</p>

              <h3>Multiple Assets Inside One NFT</h3>
              <p>NFT Teleporter allows users to upload multiple assets relevant to the NFT, which can be used to create unique online experiences. We currently allow 2D and 3D images, but also hope to expand this by adding the ability to upload unique videos, sound files and more. This will allow users to create an NFT, which upon minting will grant holders access to unique personalised content which could concievably be consumed in their web browser, smart phone, VR headset and more.</p>
